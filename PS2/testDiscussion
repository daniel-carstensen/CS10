We tested CollisionGUI in several different ways.
First, we created a few blobs using the mouse creating with Bouncers and Wanderers. We observed that blobs were
generally black but turned red when they collided with each other. Wanderers created at the same location also stayed
red. We tested the same steps using 'r' to create multiple blobs at once at random locations with equal outcomes.
We also tested the destruction mode. The blobs behaved as expected as disappeared when they collided with each other.
Further, we tested the program stability when we created a large number of blobs and sped up the timeSteps.
The program remained stable.

Further, we observed the behavior of the program when we sped up or slowed down the timeSteps. The program
remained stable and preserved its functionality.
